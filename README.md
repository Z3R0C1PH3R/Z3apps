# Z3apps
Apps made for the RG35xx+

Might work on other handhelds too, Output uses linux framebuffer so it is compatible with any linux installation.
The framework is robust and modular, and can be used to build further apps. Feel free to contribute or fork this repository to make your own apps. Dont foget to give credit though!

## Installation

1. Copy the [install-Z3apps.sh](https://github.com/Z3R0C1PH3R/Z3apps/blob/main/install-Z3apps.sh) file into your Roms/APPS folder and run it from the APPS menu after making sure the WIFI is connected.
2. Restart, now you can use the yt app in the APPS menu, you may remove the install-Z3apps.sh file.

NOTE: The app uses a default API Key, but it has a limited Quota so the app might not work then, To fix this, you can make your own YouTube API Key and place it in the Roms/APPS/Z3apps/youtube-api-v3.key file after step 1. For more info refer https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application for API key.
