# Z3apps
Apps made for the RG35xx Family

Might work on other handhelds too, Output uses linux framebuffer so it is compatible with any linux installation.
The framework is robust and modular, and can be used to build further apps. Feel free to contribute or fork this repository to make your own apps. Dont foget to give credit though!

## Installation/Updating The App

1. Copy the [install-Z3apps.sh](https://github.com/Z3R0C1PH3R/Z3apps/releases/download/v0.1/install-Z3apps.sh) file into your Roms/APPS folder and run it from the APPS menu after making sure that you are on the latest firmware, the **WIFI is connected**, the **correct time** is set in settings.
3. Your device would restart which means the install/update was successful, you may remove the install-Z3apps.sh file. If it doesnt restart and just exits then the install probably failed, check the log files.

NOTE: The app uses a default API Key, but it has a limited Quota so the app might not work then, To fix this, you can make your own YouTube API Key and place it in the Roms/APPS/Z3apps/youtube-api-v3.key file after step 1. Refer [Step By Step Guide to Generate a Key](https://github.com/Z3R0C1PH3R/Z3apps/wiki/Adding-your-own-API-Key).
