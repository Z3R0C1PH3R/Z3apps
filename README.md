# Z3apps
Apps made for the RG35xx Family

Might work on other handhelds too, Output uses linux framebuffer so it is compatible with any linux installation.
The framework is robust and modular, and can be used to build further apps. Feel free to contribute or fork this repository to make your own apps. Dont foget to give credit though!

## Installation

1. Copy the [install-Z3apps.sh](https://github.com/Z3R0C1PH3R/Z3apps/releases/download/v0.1/install-Z3apps.sh) file into your Roms/APPS folder and run it from the APPS menu after making sure the WIFI is connected.
2. Your device would restart which means the install was successful, you may remove the install-Z3apps.sh file. If it doesnt restart and just exits then the install probably failed, check the log files.

NOTE: The app uses a default API Key, but it has a limited Quota so the app might not work then, To fix this, you can make your own YouTube API Key and place it in the Roms/APPS/Z3apps/youtube-api-v3.key file after step 1. For more info refer https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application for API key.

## Usage

1. You can use the YouTube-Z3 app in the APPS menu to start the YouTube Search, a keyboard pops up
2. Use the Dpad to navivgate around, press A to enter the character.
3. Select the âœ“ button to continue, The search result window opens where you can select the video you like, use the Left and Right buttons on the Dpad to see details about the different results and press A on any of them to play that video
4. While the video is playing you have the following controls:

| Button          | Function                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| A               | Pause/Play                    |
| Dpad Right/Left | Seek 10s forward or backwards |
