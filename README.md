# Z3apps
Apps made for the RG35xx+

Might work on other handhelds too, Output uses linux framebuffer so it is compatible with any linux installation.
The framework is robust and modular, and can be used to build further apps. Feel free to contribute or fork this repository to make your own apps. Dont foget to give credit though!

## Installation

1. Copy the [install-Z3apps.sh](https://github.com/Z3R0C1PH3R/Z3apps/blob/main/install-Z3apps.sh) file into your Roms/APPS folder and run it from the APPS menu.
2. You will also need to make a YouTube API Key and place it in the Roms/APPS/Z3apps/youtube-api-v3.key file after the above step. For more info refer https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application for API key.
3. Now you can use a yt app in the APPS menu, you may remove the install-Z3apps.sh file.
